### 1. Overall Site Status

The team maintained strong momentum on multiple CRM initiatives today. Primary focus centered on finalizing expiry reminder campaigns (Phase 2-3 planning), completing app nudge implementations, and preparing content strategies for newbie and lapser customer journeys.

The project is progressing well with clear deliverables and timelines established for December execution.
