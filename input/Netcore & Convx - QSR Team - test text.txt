06/10/2025, 14:52 - Cheng Pin (Convx) added you
07/10/2025, 15:13 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ noticed this email template shared talks more on the expiry email -we discussed to prioritize the personalized journey comms on the 12th, are those ready?

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j6l3lASLWio_fyI0qwaMoxdXsPry8dPY
07/10/2025, 15:15 - Stallion Rego: Journey 1 : Redemption reminder with Expiry Notice - Users with 3/6/9/12 slices
Journey 2 : One slice away reminder with Expiry Notice - Users with 2/5/8/11 slices
07/10/2025, 16:09 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩ , this email template is for Journey 1 in sync with Liyana, that based on the slide 11 here
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFOOYWtdXeaC7kOI_VpM0wQRJohRcHuxZ_rsd6FnjAo/edit?slide=id.g387b9c06e05_0_0#slide=id.g387b9c06e05_0_0

Could you clarify if this refers to personalized journey comms or it is something else? Also, once the layout and design are confirmed, we will change the copy for Journey 2 using the same format. Basically we are using the same format for both journeys.
07/10/2025, 16:11 - Stallion Rego: Got it, this one actually is a one-time broadcast which is not time bound. We focus on journey 1 and 2 first (Slide #38 and #39).
07/10/2025, 16:12 - Pei Fang (Convx): Also, I just found out Liyana is no longer with PH. Should we liaise directly with Sham moving forward?
07/10/2025, 16:12 - Stallion Rego: Yes, wanted to update you guys on the same. We sort out the creatives ourselves and get it approved from Sham
07/10/2025, 16:13 - Stallion Rego: We can connect tomorrow to finalize the creatives
07/10/2025, 16:13 - Stallion Rego: The new CRM manager will be joining next week 13th
07/10/2025, 16:16 - Pei Fang (Convx): Noted, shall we do tomorrow 10am?
07/10/2025, 16:17 - Stallion Rego: 11am please if possible
07/10/2025, 16:34 - Pei Fang (Convx): Yup can
08/10/2025, 11:29 - Stallion Rego: <Media omitted>
08/10/2025, 14:29 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩ , I've left comment on slide 38 & 39 before we proceed with the amendments. You can check it out
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFOOYWtdXeaC7kOI_VpM0wQRJohRcHuxZ_rsd6FnjAo/edit?slide=id.g373d5a68167_0_958#slide=id.g373d5a68167_0_958
08/10/2025, 14:48 - Stallion Rego: Sure @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ the copy sounds good, we can proceed! Please duplicate the existing templates for the changes
08/10/2025, 15:23 - Pei Fang (Convx): Got it! Just to align for the visual that we shared for one-time broadcast, do we send it on 13 Nov or it is not scheduled yet?
08/10/2025, 15:28 - Stallion Rego: We will decide the schedule for that one next month - maybe early nov
08/10/2025, 16:50 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩ , we can’t find the original file of slide 38 in Gdrive that Liyana shared. Just wondering if you have it, or who should we get it from
08/10/2025, 17:02 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ can you try this drive, it has all the assets:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YcEM9SzcBwJg43BCbgtLSvoUnPKM6_Ad?usp=sharing
10/10/2025, 11:00 - Brendan Zhi: Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩ & @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩, I've created another sheet specifically for visual asset sharing within Pizza Hut CRM Campaign Calendar. I noticed that the visual asset is shared all over the place (dm, email, groups). Just want it to be centralized so, we smoothen out any possible frictions. Just a simple table, if you see any thing that would be a good addition. By all means, add it in! Thanks

10/10/2025, 11:39 - Stallion Rego: Noted. Thanks @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩
10/10/2025, 12:10 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ do we have the new templates ready for the 12th automation? We have to make the changes today - let me know what time we can connect.
10/10/2025, 12:21 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩ , all copies and visuals are ready, pending to set up. Shall we connect at 3pm today, to go thru it in case anything goes wrong
10/10/2025, 12:44 - Stallion Rego: Can we connect at 2pm? or 3.30pm?

10/10/2025, 15:49 - Stallion Rego: <Media omitted>
13/10/2025, 13:27 - Brendan Zhi: Hey @⁨Stallion Rego⁩, do you have any availability tomorrow 14th Oct (Tuesday) after 330pm? We can jump right into Abandonment Cart Journey based on our plan <This message was edited>
13/10/2025, 13:32 - Brendan Zhi: Also a quick heads-up. Our designer will be out for wed-fri this week. So, one of the visuals for abandonment cart journey might not make it in time. Though we can still move ahead with setting up the flow and content logic first, then slot in the visual next week when its ready. How does that sound with you?
13/10/2025, 13:45 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ noted on this, the flow is setup last time - we just need to slot in the visual next week
13/10/2025, 13:45 - Stallion Rego: Won't be available next week - maybe we can connect on Wed to go over the other use cases
13/10/2025, 13:46 - Brendan Zhi: Do you mean tomorrow not available? Sorry confuse by your reply 😅
13/10/2025, 13:47 - Stallion Rego: Yes tomorrow, sorry

13/10/2025, 13:48 - Stallion Rego: Lets do first half? 11 or 12?
13/10/2025, 13:49 - Brendan Zhi: 11am sounds good to me. Let's lock that in
22/10/2025, 13:56 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ hope you had a good deepavali break. Wanted to check when we can add on the cart abandon creative?
22/10/2025, 18:17 - Brendan Zhi: Hi Stallon, apologies. My message didn't go through. @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ will be liasing with our designer on the creative. Will get this up by end of this week.
22/10/2025, 18:18 - Brendan Zhi: Just curious. If I recalled correctly. There are offline meet up with PH team supposing tomorrow or that is no longer the case?
23/10/2025, 12:03 - Stallion Rego: Hey Brendan - Sham just got back from her leaves today. I'll follow up and confirm a time.
23/10/2025, 12:11 - Stallion Rego: @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ here is the report I've prepared for the meeting for your reference. At the end of these slides we will present the opportunities - the entire CRM plan + high impact initiatives.

23/10/2025, 12:50 - Brendan Zhi: Hi Stallon, thanks for this. Just noticed it from your slide. Do you expect us to add the deck that I share with you into yours?

07/11/2025, 14:35 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ I hope we can present the first-draft of the journey plan for newbies and lapsers in our Monday syncup to Asyila / Sham ?

17/11/2025, 11:31 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩, sure. I agree that we should switch to a higher quality image for this.

17/11/2025, 11:33 - Stallion Rego: I'd suggest to take a look on the website and then request Asyila to get the working file from designer
17/11/2025, 11:36 - Pei Fang (Convx): Got it, will reach out to Asyila directly on this
17/11/2025, 15:42 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ notes from the call for you to share : https://notes.granola.ai/d/98d4dc12-9191-467f-aab5-72733b4b4c42

19/11/2025, 12:42 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi Stallon, I’ll be sharing the milestone and a journey overview with Asyila today. Just a one slide as requested. Shall we connect until I drafted the full journey details?

19/11/2025, 12:48 - Pei Fang (Convx): Okay, let’s connect at 4:30pm today?
19/11/2025, 17:29 - Stallion Rego: Thanks for the call @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ the journey plan looks solid. As discussed, lets please start preparing the content so we can take the journey live this month itself.

We will have another follow-up meeting with the CMO early Dec and she would expect to see some progress.
19/11/2025, 17:36 - Pei Fang (Convx): Sure, we will start prepping the content. Thanks for the heads up Stallon
25/11/2025, 09:17 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ good morning. Can you help Asyila with the Sooka campaign request?
25/11/2025, 09:22 - Pei Fang (Convx): Morning @⁨Stallion Rego⁩ , do you mean the campaign set up?
25/11/2025, 09:30 - Stallion Rego: Yes, the segment and campaign
25/11/2025, 09:31 - Stallion Rego: I think Asyila already shared the content over email
25/11/2025, 10:41 - Pei Fang (Convx): I’ve input everything from the email. Before we proceed, could you review the segment and content to ensure everything is set up correctly?

Campaign ID: 3808
Campaign name: Sooka Campaign

25/11/2025, 10:50 - Brendan Zhi: <Media omitted>
01/12/2025, 11:57 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ wanted to check if we have the content strategy ready for the newbie journeys discussed? It would be a good time to review with Asyila and get started with testing.
01/12/2025, 12:04 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi Stallon, as per last sync with Asyila, there will have some amendments to the journey points to be discussed. Once that is finalised, we will further dive into the content details
01/12/2025, 12:11 - Stallion Rego: Okay I hope these conversations are being documented. If there are delays in finalization make sure its documented yeah
04/12/2025, 16:02 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ thanks for joining the call - lets share the minutes and next steps for Asyila and wait for her response on the initiatives she wants us to drive this month.
04/12/2025, 16:02 - Stallion Rego: Chat with meeting transcript: [https://notes.granola.ai/t/97e49d61-3533-44c7-b119-0ea19c5851a1](https://notes.granola.ai/t/97e49d61-3533-44c7-b119-0ea19c5851a1)
04/12/2025, 16:03 - Stallion Rego: Also, I feel we should drive an AB test for the late-lunch opportunity we identified last time. Aileen liked it and it won't take much time to push out a few Push Notifications to test the waters. A quick win perhaps if it works.
04/12/2025, 16:07 - Pei Fang (Convx): Thanks Stallon for sharing this. Yup sounds good, let us start prepping that details out
04/12/2025, 16:17 - Stallion Rego: Also, @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ when you create any broadcast campaign on the dashboard, please use the following naming convention. Got to know that some backend logics are added to identify our contribution from the "VV CRM" tag added in the name. Also the segment should be populated from CDP and not Netcore : 

VV CRM - VALUE - PN - 211125 - YEP VALUE - CONVERSION - ALL CUSTOMER
04/12/2025, 16:40 - Pei Fang (Convx): Could you share on what’s the structure of the naming, and what should we name it for SOOKA campaign for example? For the segment number, do you mean we can only justify it based on CDP?
04/12/2025, 16:43 - Stallion Rego: Yup, the value management dashboard that they have built is based on the segments created via CDP. Basically they match the activation name on CDP to the list used in our campaign.

Campaign sample: VV CRM - LTO - EDM - 261125 - SOOKA CAMPAIGN - ENGAGEMENT - KLANG
04/12/2025, 18:05 - Pei Fang (Convx): Alrightt noted that
08/12/2025, 11:37 - Stallion Rego: <Media omitted>
08/12/2025, 12:53 - Brendan Zhi: What would you recommend in naming convention?
08/12/2025, 12:53 - Stallion Rego: Here follow this ^
08/12/2025, 12:55 - Stallion Rego: For example : VV CRM - VALUE - APN - 091225 - 2 FOR RM22 - CONVERSION - ALL APP USER
08/12/2025, 12:57 - Stallion Rego: We try to tag the campaign category based on the following:
- VALUE - for app only deals or cheaper value offers
- LTO - for limited time only menu promos
- TACTICAL - if targeted to a specific group / segment
- ADHOC - for other one time requests not tied to any campaign
08/12/2025, 14:53 - +60 11-6278 4501: Hi @⁨Jonas Lim (Convx)⁩ 

Requesting the team to please try and update roadmap with KPIs on weekly basis? 

This will be a single source of truth to have no conflicts in future- I am taking buy in from Pizza hut on this so that October type situation never arises in future.

08/12/2025, 15:11 - Brendan Zhi: Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩, can you assist me on checking for one-time blast EDM on netcore. Please help to verify and advise req:
1. Campaign name
2. Segments/List target name --> I have used (ID-1203 Active App Users && ID-1097 VV_Active 90D_660215)

*Segment focuses on group:*
1. Recent Active Users (<90days)
2. App Users (someone who install & engaged) / Partial App users (someone who install but didn't engage)

10/12/2025, 18:16 - Stallion Rego: The time to live you need to keep within the timer end time. E.g. if timer ends on 12th 11pm then your TTL on schedule page should be 12th 11pm or 10pm

17/12/2025, 14:46 - Pei Fang (Convx): Hi @⁨Stallion Rego⁩ , could you grant the access to Brendan and I for setting up app nudges, so that we can assist on the execution when it’s needed. I believe it should be under Engage > Personalization > App
18/12/2025, 11:36 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ yes I'll walk you guys through today on how to setup nudges. Are you guys free around 5pm?
18/12/2025, 12:35 - Stallion Rego: Hi @⁨Jonas Lim (Convx)⁩ @⁨Cheng Pin (Convx)⁩ @⁨Pei Fang (Convx)⁩ @⁨Brendan Zhi⁩ we have aligned with Sham to have a business review and roadmap planning session in week of 12th Jan 2026. We will first run through the plan with Sham online and then schedule for the session with Aileen in person the following week.

Let's create a comprehensive data-driven roadmap with potential opportunities that we identify backed by projected uplift that we can bring in 2026. We will voice out the plans, get feedback and then lock it in with clear timelines for both sides to strictly follow.

I will help put together the data for what has been done so far but would need your expertise on the road-mapping.
